	<h4>The use of blockqoute</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in
		what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>
		<p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written
		down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each
		conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in
		the interpretation.</p>

	<!--pre formatted text : doesn't ignore the white spaces-->
	<h4>The use of pre formatted text</h4>
	<pre>
		if x=5:
			print('hello world')
		else:
			print('did you learn something or not')
	</pre>
	<!--use of figure, figure caption
		though not intended but you might see <code> tag as well probably to highlight specifically for code section, and also to note code is under the <pre> tag-->
	<h4>The use of figures</h4>
	<figure>
		<img src="images\batman.jpg" alt="shows a batman logo">
