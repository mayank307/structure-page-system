	<!--below is a short example with heading and the paragraph-->
	<h2>Why we need headings</h2>
	<p>It is very important to segregate the portions of the page and give users different sections within a topic, it helps for easy direction as well we tend to write less and give an overview </p>
	<h3>We will take an example of creative process</h3>
	<p>The process might look simple but it  isn't, let me walk you through. The following section will have headings under which I will talk about how the heading influences the thought pattern and why anyone and everyone cannot.</p>
	<h6>Staring at the sky</h6>
	<p>How this has changed me ? The thing about creative process is to feel blank most of the time while your inner mind knows that it is preparing for that sort of thinking which you wont find in books.</p>
	<h6>Making a hell lot of mistakes and making them fast</h6>
	<p>Just make mistakes it will teach you a lot trust me it will make you bold and you wont think twice before doing something.</p>
	<h6>there are many more points which I shall add later</h6>
	<!--thematic break,a horizontal rule, logical divider. The hr element adds a logical divider between sections of a page or paragraphs without introducing a new heading level.-->
