  <p>Throughout my college days, I have tried to explore as much as possible and guess what still continuing to do so. The best way to stay creative is to be free from your own set of rules, try to figure out of the box, and just let ideas flow work a lot towards collecting ideas from sources and then put your own analysis on it. Try to build new stuff instead of just copying from someone, create and build stuffs to impact huge audience.
